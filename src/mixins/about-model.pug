            p NewDrugTargets.org is an interactive visualization tool for discovering interesting associations between diseases and potential drug targets.
            p.
                span We used natural language processing to identify disease and protein mentions in the text
                of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" target="_blank">PubMed</a>
                abstracts. Using this data, we derived two metrics: #[strong novelty] and #[strong importance]. Novelty measures the
                relative scarcity of specific publications about a given concept (such as a target or a disease),
                while importance measures the relative strength of the association between two concepts. We then built
                this web tool, which enables users to explore the relationships between the novelty of potential drug targets
                and their importance to diseases.
            p Our approach was guided by the following assumptions:
            ul
                li A target that is mentioned in many abstracts that also mention a specific disease is likely to be of importance to that disease.
                li A target or disease that is mentioned in fewer abstracts is more novel and less well understood.
                li Abstracts which mention only a few targets and diseases are more specific and should be given greater weight than those which mention many.
            p For more details about how these scores are computed, please see <a href="static/poster.pdf" target="_blank">this poster</a>.
